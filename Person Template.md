Origin: put the fucker's orgin here

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \

// notes for a user, personality traits, bits of lore they were in, dont really matter, just put it in here!

\\\ (put 3 backslashes to have 2 show up, its formatting weirdness) this line for extra elaboration on the above note

// there are exactly 19 backslashes sepereated by single spaces in the spacers

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \

// this charater's relations with other charater, for example, how Alcramo sacrificed himself to revive Noble

// or if someone is canonically married, or arch enemies with someone
