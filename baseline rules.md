these are not server rules, but basic rules of how the canon works, on a more fundimental level and opens up extra rp things
## Bets
- If both parties agree to it when making a bet a magic can be invoked to bind one's soul into an object, such as their own head (heads being the most common example as they are generated upon death) or a token, as part of the bet. Henceforth if the opposing party comes into possession of said object they will own said soul, and given that the soul is the root of will and conscience this means they would own the person who's soul it is.
## Builders
'builders' is the catch-all term for every group that checks the following requirements:
- can craft and build with little difficulty, as if it is a natural extension of them
- access to ender chests (any one else sees the end of the in-game texture)
- an inherent knowledge of all blocks within reach, and how to use them
## Dragons
there is not one specific dragon, but a *lot* of dragons. 
- there are several "main" end islands (the one you spawn on after using the portal)
	- these islands are used as breeding grounds, we don't see any other main islands because they are rare as hell and millions of blocks away from each other if you're *lucky*.
	- canonically, the egg is there when we get there, yes, this is a retcon.

- dragons are similar to that of the phoenix, in a sense. primarily that when one is killed it can be brought back, as it's 'essence' still remains where it was killed, and can be brought back into the flesh with end crystals.
	- you actually get a very small part of the dragon's essence as xp on killing it, the other 99% is dispersed into the air, and thus cant be collected.
	- because you effectively remove a portion of the dragon when it dies, eventually there isn't enough dragon for the end crystals to put back together, this takes STUPID long, however.

- dragon eggs take several centuries to hatch, and can theoretically be born in the overworld, just every time one *has* begun to hatch while the egg was in the overworld, everyone lost their shit and returned it to the end when it hatched.
