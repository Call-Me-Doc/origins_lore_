these are not server rules, but basic rules of how the canon works, on a more fundamental level and opens up extra rp things
## Bets
- If both parties agree to it when making a bet a magic can be invoked to bind one's soul into an object, such as their own head (heads being the most common example as they are generated upon death) or a token, as part of the bet. Henceforth if the opposing party comes into possession of said object they will own said soul, and given that the soul is the root of will and conscience this means they would own the person who's soul it is.
## Builders
'builders' is the catch-all term for every group that checks the following requirements:
- can craft and build with little difficulty, as if it is a natural extension of them
- access to ender chests (any one else sees the end of the in-game texture)
- an inherent knowledge of all blocks within reach, and how to use them
## Dragons
there is not one specific dragon, but a *lot* of dragons. 
- there are several "main" end islands (the one you spawn on after using the portal)
	- these islands are used as breeding grounds, we don't see any other main islands because they are rare as hell and millions of blocks away from each other if you're *lucky*.
	- canonically, the egg is there when we get there, yes, this is a retcon.

- dragons are similar to that of the phoenix, in a sense. primarily that when one is killed it can be brought back, as it's 'essence' still remains where it was killed, and can be brought back into the flesh with end crystals.
	- you actually get a very small part of the dragon's essence as xp on killing it, the other 99% is dispersed into the air, and thus cant be collected.
	- because you effectively remove a portion of the dragon when it dies, eventually there isn't enough dragon for the end crystals to put back together, this takes STUPID long, however.

- dragon eggs take several centuries to hatch, and can theoretically be born in the overworld, just every time one *has* begun to hatch while the egg was in the overworld, everyone lost their shit and returned it to the end when it hatched.

## True Deaths
Builders are able to respawn an indefinite amount of times, this is known to just about everyone, and thus is not surprising to see builders doing "really stupid shit" that would end in anyone else dying. 

Death means nothing to builders, be it poison, stabbing, great heights, or falling into the void itself. But, when a Builder's body begins to fail them all by itself, nothing can save them from death's cold grasp.

However, a soul with the ability to return to it's body time and time again won't just vanish as easily as the flesh. Often, a soul with unfinished business (be it love, the want to finish a project, or simply not ready for death just quite yet) will enter Purgatory. 

## Purgatory
The realm of souls who have not given up on life quite just yet.

The living cannot directly interact with Purgatory, but they share the same land (ghosts cant change things about purgatory, but the living can), however, if a ghost has enough willpower, they can force themselves back into the land of the living. This takes immense focus, however, as if they slip up for even a second they will be forced back into Purgatory.
Despite most souls entering it's doors as ghosts, (known as 'shadows' when they return to the realm of the living) time spent without anything binding them to themselves can cause several issues with them, such as:
- personality decay
- loss of empathy
- obsession over their unfinished business
- loss of colored vision
- loss of sense of self
- surprise at the ability to interact with the world (when returning back to the land of the living)

## Gods

God is the word that mortal folk use to describe the infinitesimally rare occurrence where a person is born with an immortal soul for one reason or another, with more durable bodies and eternal youth. Gods are generally immune to all natural ailments as well. They become associated with concepts because of how they act, for example [[Noble_Oraiste]], a gambler, became the god of luck and gold. Demigods are also commonly talked of, but they're even rarer than gods, a god could have a thousand children and not one would inherit even an ounce of divinity, and so they are believed to be myths among gods. There are many things that are also called gods by mortals that aren't true gods, mainly pseudogods (also known as godlings or semigods) which are beings who have gained immortality like that of a god through one method or another, but because they weren't born with it they don't have the same empowered bodies.
