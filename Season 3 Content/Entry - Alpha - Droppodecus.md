# **Day 11**

I've made it, I've finally made it to Xelumemu. I hope there's some of my kin's left over magi-tech here... But chances are that's all rusted beyond use. I'm looking at the crevice I need to go down at the moment. Based on the landmarks I am sure it is down here.

Managed to tunnel my way down... It is just as I imagined... in shambles. Not only that, but that the sculk infection still lives down here. What a resilient bio-weapon that is. I don't know if any of our ancestors knew what they we're dealing with.

Fuck... I've woken one of them up. I can hear it's growls, and its damp feet slump. I hope it just goes back to sleep.

That was a close call, the Warden seems to have crawled back into the ground. In the meanwhile I've been looking through chests. Seems I found some manuscripts of what I was looking for- documentation on my artificers life extension experiments.

# **Day 37**

The demon in my eye has been talking frequently lately. Not sure how to blank it out. It's been weeks apart between writing these paragraphs. I've set up a camp in the meanwhile mostly brewing the serums that will keep my organs from failing with age.

Been slowly starting to remember who I am. My full title is Droppodecus Kalazier Majorus - The Echo Emperor. My people declared war on those sub-human savages that dared to call themselves Gods. They came to me one day and forced me to hand over everything I had in exchange for not slashing me down. Can you guess which option I chose? Anyways, long tale shortened the Gods ended up "winning" but that term is too positive for what the outcome was. They couldn't lay a finger on my kingdom. Not after what we did to it. Not after we let the sculk in. I'm getting tired, I must rest now.

# **Day 89**

Been clearing some of the sculk from... well everywhere I've noticed it gives off quite a bit of green essence when prying it of the floor and walls. It seems I'm absorbing it, strangely I recalled it in my trance state during my insanity back at Stoneward. I wonder how the others are holding up. I'm sure they we're done with my shit a while ago, but I still wish them well.

# **Day 93**

Started a side project- try to open the portal to our home realm. That's where we got the sculk. There is a citadel on the otherside apparently according to those unfortunate enough to go through. I'll see if I can open it and find anything useful on the other side.

# **Day 154**

I'VE DONE IT. NOT EVEN THOSE FALSE GODS COULD DO IT. I've opened the portal to our realm. Our original home incase we ever lost this plain. It was not the home we once knew... barely habitable, however I need to see what's inside. The portal is unstable. I need to walk in and out fast.

# **NEVER AGAIN**

I closed the gateway. Something looked at me in there. SOMETHING LOOKED AT ME THORUGH THE DARKNESS. I'm staying out of there for now. I'm going to rest, it's been a trip.

# **Day 156**

Remembered what the green stuff is. I'm just calling it energy for now. It is used for Enchantments. I suppose... how do I describe it... Ok.
Think of your memories, now think of them as an essence that can be channeled out of your brain when you... put it into a book. That's what I can describe in simpleton terms at least. But the dead  know I am not the best to explain it. The potions have been keeping me alive but barely. I need to research more. My skin has started to rot off. I can feel my brain rotting again.

We need more power... more mana... more strength.

The ritual is set up. WE WILL BE COMPLETE.

The Gods shall fear what we have become.

# ***HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN ?**

Holy fuck. I slept for way too long, it feels like I've been here for centuries now? I noticed dust over my setups. I blacked out? Apparently a ritual succeeded? I don't remember setting one up. Anyways I feel better than I have in my entire long life. 

No. This isn't right. I'm not sleeping for a while.

Ok... my skin is made of shadows and I burn in the sunlight like a zombie. Am I dead? Am I one of those phantoms now? I can't go through walls. But I'm also not a green hue like they are... Well one things for certain. I'm not going to the surface anymore.

I ate sculk today. Normal food makes my sick. I hate it. Energy is my food now. I extract it from sculk, or by beating other creatures to death. This is my life now.

I miss the others. I'm so alone here... The wardens have started to ignore me... even the sculk dosen't react to me. Please someone other than this demon in my head.

I don't want to continue... 

But you will. You always will. I will make you.

I'm making a break for it, I need fresh air. I'll go outside at night once the sun sets... I hate the sun

KILL THE SUN

*KILL THE SUN*

Stumbled across a camp named Firelink Shine. There's a cave underneath of it, Perfect. The fucking sun is rising again. GET US OUT OF THE LIGHT.
