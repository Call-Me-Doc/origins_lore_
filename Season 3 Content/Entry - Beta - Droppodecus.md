# **I don't keep track of the days anymore**

I've found my friend in the cave I was hiding in. The potato man, Marigi. The only human at Stoneward. Although he doesn't look human anymore. Apparently sleep paralysis demons are just spawning from dead people's spirits now. I've done some research into demonology, but only so much. This is does however tell me how long I've been asleep. My estimation is about 200-350 years.

Everyone I knew is dead. All of them. Stoneward may be a forgotten group now by anyone else but us. There are no remnants of the fortress I even built. By Potato man's description the entire mountain vanished. Very strange, all of this is.

# **Is this what the Gods suffer through, immortality?**

As much as I want to let the past go I can't. I am an undying memory of the atrocities committed against my people... But atrocities I will put THEM through. We will be worse.

Necromancy.

We will bring them back. They will be stronger, than before. WE WILL KILL THE GODS. Or at least we will in time, given the current circumstances. I will need to play my cards carefully.

# **Dragon slaying**

I overheard a group of adventurers. Apparently they are going to the End dimension? Curiosity overtook me and I covered my translucent skin up with my armor to avoid being questioned. Might be good to get away from Marigi as it seems his mentality is not the best.

I followed them from a distance to avoid conversation. But I eventually was spotted and  questioned. I simply stated that I knew about The End and what it would entail. They apparently trusted me enough to let me go with them. That was easy.

We're at the stronghold now standing in front of the portal. From what I have read about the End it is a barren void dimension. If you fall of one of the islands, you fall endlessly into oblivion, the void.

I'll write back in this book once I'm done with this dragon.

# **Idiots, incompetency even.**

 The dragon fight went well even if some of the others got a significant amount of blood loss. But when we landed the killing blow the dragon evaporated, and an egg dropped from it. I saw potential in this asset but so did everyone else. They instantly started trying to rub it with their grubby little hands. One of the idiots said they we're yelling something about... turning into a backpack? Like that makes any fucking sense. As a response the egg teleported and fell through the exit portal.

Apparently one of the Gods picked it up. THE SAME BEINGS WHO MASSACURED MY PEOPLE AND LEFT US TO RUINS. ALL BECAUSE YOU FUCKS HAD TO PLAY TUG OF WAR WITH THE MCGUFFIN.

Mortals. I see why my people surpassed you every step of the way. You do nothing but bicker over who get what and then start several wars over it. Then those Gods win in the end anyways.

I'm pissed, needless to say. I'm going forward with my plans. They will know of my wrath.

# **Tell me. Where do souls go to die?**

Some may continue to live in the material plane by becoming a phantom. Not to be confused with the monsters of the night sky. They may also become a demon by tethering their soul to the Nether when passing through purgatory to the astral planes. Sleep paralysis demons are demons that come back to the overworld and feed on the energy of the living. Blazeborn are demon spirits reincarnated by possesing a fire golem or as some call them blazes.

Not all the others will come back. Entropy of energy throughout the universe may prove difficult this far into the future. All souls fade away to be recycled again into new life. Even if I tried to find the others they may already be existing as someone else... with different memories.

# **The magic of this realm has evolved**

I've been practicing old magic again. My people exceled in wizardry, more than any other races. When I began this journey from Stoneward. Magic seemed like it was struggling. Sure you could enchant items and use souls for power in things like enchanting. But it was so much more than that back in the ancient times. Wizard combat was a popular form of entertainment for my people. Two magicians had a verbal disagreement? Oh well, time to put them in the arena and let their spells do the talking. But something in the air just... drained, or thinned out. Like diluting a potion with water until it's effects are barely noticeable.

I am unsure of what caused this change. Regardless I'm happy the magic in the atmosphere is back in full form.

It's perfect for what we are about to do.

# **Revival**

We've prepared the ritual sequence. We will need to do 3 rituals to bring the Boxpaul back. First we need to construct a soul catalyst, second is the summoning to lure him out, then the same ritual I used to ascend to Godlike status.

Let's hope that all will go well.

# **That took longer than expected**

It took a couple of trys to get him to wake up from his astral sleep but Boxpaul Jones lives again. Renewed into the dark god of copper and greed. Although we have a problem. The extraction left a tear through reality. Usually this isn't noticeable as the reality tear seals itself in a matter of minutes, but since we attempted multiple times the mana went though an... exponential reaction... and carved a massive hole through the sky.

We should probably depart now since the locals will notice this.

Although I could use this to my advantage... leverage even.

# **The tyranny of the sun**

While I was crawling out of the cave at dusk I noticed something... A yellow axolotl swimming in a water hole, next to it was a sign. "Solarire, Warriors of the sun" I though it was odd someone would leave their pet so exposed. The little one was alone so... I took him. I had a yellow axolotl once, his name was Mustard. Anyways I am already not fond of these sunlight warriors as,

1. I loathe the sunlight, 
2. If I didn't take him something else would have gotten him. Watch your kid in other words.
3. You already made me loose an asset.

Well I hope to get that asset back one way or another. Having a pet dragon would benefit us. We'll get it by either stealing it or killing those gods. We'll return to Xelumemu. As I'd rather not be bothered, and also to give my new friend a nicer home.

Marigi said he's going to dig a new hole, so we're going to part ways. Box is coming with me.

# **A metamorphosis?**

I overheard something from a Vulpine I think their name was Doc or something. Apparently the end dimension underwent a drastic change. New fauna and creatures were spotted, and its climate... like the islands are tropical now?

A fascinating change, I may study some of the new plants there sometime.

Anyways me and Box have arrived and he's said he wants to build a hive city. Who is he planning to house in the city? I don't know, perhaps the villagers I have in captivity? I suppose having our operations expanded wouldn't hurt. He also wanted a metric shitton of copper. I'll see what I can do for you friend.

# **The moth god**

A man appeared in Xelumemu. I didn't recognize him so I began stopping on a sculk shrieker to wake up a warden. I got blasted with a beam of arcane energy. The beam was so intense it blasted of a bit of my shadows, also called my skin.

He said goes by The Moth God and said he wanted to join Echos of The Ancients. Well then. I just made sure he wouldn't disclose the location of Xelumemu. As I saw potential of the wizard, and his arcane energy.

It seems we have a new member of our syndicate then, today has been a strange day. I am still in pain after that blast. Maybe I should sleep, still skeptical about sleeping after my ascension mind you, but I'm too tired to care.

# **Strange Dreams**

Last night I had a vivid dream. Tall walls around a city, above ground on a mountain, a wisp of cold air in the atmosphere, and the chatter of people around me. The strange thing is... I DONT REMEMBER THIS CITY EXISTING, YET I FELT COMFORT IN IT, LIKE I HAD LIVED THERE BEFORE.

As I was saying... I looked around the town, almost if I knew EVERY. SINGLE. PATHWAY. What's so peculiar about this settlement you may be asking? Aside from the stone walls being abnormally tall, everyone looked at me with... admiration. Thats when I realized I was wearing... almost military general style robes... yeah those ones with the tassels on the sides?

Then the eye from the other side appeared in the dark green sky. It opened up it told me "NONE OF THIS IS REAL, YOU ARE NOT YOU, WAKE UP". Then it flashed all the colors under the sun and... I did. I woke up. I can almost remember that city's name but, why? Why do I care about something that I have no knowledge of?

I don't like this. I'm not sleeping again for a while. I don't need to. I'll be fine.

# **Expanded contacts**

Sometime back I offered some mending enchanted books to some mortals. They kept asking me for more until I just gave up. What the hell do you need so many mending books for? Anyways I did give them the location of Xelumemu for my Testificate worker who makes them, the only thing they had to worry about was waking a Warden. However I did let them know if they disclosed the location of this city I would rain hellfire upon them.

Anyways they contacted me again... I hope it's not more mending books.
