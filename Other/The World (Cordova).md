Fun Facts:
 // It is mandatory to go through sword training by the time you're 16 in Cordova.
 
 // To stop a paradox, the paradoxical object becomes lean.
 
 // Given this world is equivalent to about 1000 AD Europe in many respects (tech, culture, etc.) most people likely can't read in the modern sense, being able to pronounce the words but not understanding them. This means about 50% of the men and about 1% of the women of this world would actually understand what they read, and even less would be able to write. Given this is also skewed heavily towards nobles the fact there are so many normal people able to read and write in one area would be found very surprising. 
	\\ \\ however, because this is also minecraft, everyone can read.
   
 // Originally, there were no gods in Cordova, however, all of the current gods were imported.
 
 // If both parties agree to it when making a bet a magic can be invoked to bind one's soul into an object, such as their own head (heads being the most common example as they are generated upon death) or a token, as part of the bet. Henceforth if the opposing party comes into possession of said object they will own said soul, and given that the soul is the root of will and conscience this means they would own the person who's soul it is.

 // Cordova is a land of myth where fantasies come true, one of which being the dead rising from their grave on their own. The actual cause of this is a sheep, who drank from a Fountain of Life and attained immortality, who was cursed by a necromancer that was annoyed due to it chewing his robe and was promptly dumped in Cordova. The curse causes dead bodies around the sheep to reanimate, but unintentionality made the undead treat the sheep as their summoner and so not attack the sheep, even following it's will. As the sheep's will is to eat, because it is an animal, the undead will attack people to consume their flesh.

// Cordova was also in the past known for it's abundance of maid dresses, caused by a petty gold-hating maid-obsessed magus who sacrificed her life to curse all gold on the continent of Cordova to become a maid dress if crafted into armor. This is no longer considered special as the curse eventually spread to the rest of the world.
	\\ \\ This includes accessories, causing necklaces to become cute chokers, for example.

// The Cordovan legal system is oddly similar to that of America. However, it lacks a majority of construction safety laws.
