God is the word that mortal folk use to describe the infinitesimally rare occurence where a person is born with a immortal soul for one reason or another, with more durable bodies and eternal youth. They become associated with concepts because of how they act, for example Noble a gambler became the god of luck and gold. Demigods are also commonly talked of, but they're even rarer than gods, a god could have a thousand children and not one would inherit even an ounce of divinity, and so they are believed to be myths among gods.
