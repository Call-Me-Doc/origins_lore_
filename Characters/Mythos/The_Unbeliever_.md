Origin: War God

Traits
 Knows who [[The Barrel Admirer]] is

Places of Worship: The bloodsoaked ground is his temple, every battle is an act of worship to him. 
Religion: Most everyone knows of the war god in one way or another, with the exception of the land they've come to recently, too peaceful (until recently) to know the blood god's name. 

A very old god of war that revels in bloodshed, basically a genocidal maniac that only likes murder, torture, and food. Kind of an asshole, acquaintances with [[Noble_Oraiste]]. They've come from far away to these lands hearing that a war was brewing and are delighted with what they've found, a land who doesn't even know who they are.
