A Dragon is what happens when the same thing that in a human soul makes a God happens to a reptile. Because reptiles continue to grow their entire lives a thousand year old Dragon is about the size of a house and the traits of theirs that you wouldn't expect on reptiles, like wings or many heads, is a result of the unique way that the physical enhancements interact with reptile physiology. Additionaly with reptile bodies being innately receptive to elemental energies, it's why salamanders are associated with fire for example, and said receptiveness being boosted by the body enhancements these immortal lizards begin to gain elemental powers and traits on the level of Elementals (which is what happens when an element spontaneously gains a soul), for example a Dragon which lives by a volcano turning red and breathing fire.
