God is the word that mortal folk use to describe the infinitesimally rare occurence where a person is born with an immortal soul for one reason or another, with more durable bodies and eternal youth. Gods are generally immune to all natural ailments as well. They become associated with concepts because of how they act, for example [[Noble_Oraiste]], a gambler, became the god of luck and gold. Demigods are also commonly talked of, but they're even rarer than gods, a god could have a thousand children and not one would inherit even an ounce of divinity, and so they are believed to be myths among gods. There are many things that are also called gods by mortals that aren't true gods, mainly pseudogods (also known as godlings or semigods) which are beings who have gained immortality like that of a god through one method or another, but because they weren't born with it they don't have the same empowered bodies.
