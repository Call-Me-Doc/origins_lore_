Ancient Builders are a race of extremely long lived peoples with great technology who once ruled the world as a mighty empire, left as but the ruins of an extinct people after they challenged the gods nearly 600 years ago, but not before they almost defeated the gods in an awe despiring display. Or so the fairy tale goes, in reality the battle was much more one sided, more of a slaughter than a fight though the AB did take one few gods down with them. AB are more frail than other peoples, a result of living to a maximum of a thousand years by less than natural means, but can fly with anti-gravity magical crystals implanted in their own bodies.
