I decided to start keeping a journal, just in case I end up dying. gods thats a way to start something, hmm? well, if you find this im either dead or I lost this, I hope you can use intuition as to which one is the correct answer.

something happened a couple minutes ago, I killed the new dragon in the end an hour or two ago with some others (they started arguing as to weather they should use it to make a backpack or not, I was on the side of 'its cool let it not be a backpack'), anyway, something happened to the end.

none of us were actually there, but we all *felt* it, like a shift in our heads. pretty much everyone who's been around has been to the end, and killed a dragon at least once, so we all knew something was wrong. the pillars were.. detailed with a material I had never seen before. the strangest part was *I know what its called. its flavolite. everyone else was already calling it that without me saying anything.*

we went through one of those little portals that take you to an outer island, whatever they're called, and EVERYTHING was wrong. there were slimes, water, TREES for gods sake! something weird has happened, and I've been working on setting up rest points around, like I have with the overworld.

I've been exploring the new end, and on further investigation there's so many new things to see.
I wouldn't comment on most of them, but the strangest things is the fact there's so many crashed ships. I don't know how those things flew in the first place, but apparently their power can end. ive been trying to place waystones in the broken ships as I go so people can get home if they get lost, but I'm not surprised if others get much further than me.

I havent noticed this gods know how many times, but I was exploring with [[Noble]] and found a *house.* that wouldnt be weird if there were inhabitants, villagers and pillagers can build things just fine, just slowly, but there was nobody there, not even evidence someone's been there in at least a year. 
the dust was suffocating.

--- 

was exploring south in the end, and came across this broken portal thingy, and it got me thinking about how I know the names of all these new materials. I asked that [[Karma |slime lady]] what flavolite was called, and she looked at me like I had a second head, and she told me it was flavolite (I expected it, but it confirmed my suspicion.)

I think the end swapped places with another reality's end. it sounds crazy, coming from a crazy person who talks to endermen because nobody want to go end exploring with me. not helping doc. anyway, heres my reasons:
- everyone felt the sudden shift, and a good chunk of us didnt even bother to check if something happened to the nether
- new iron adjacent material, but it needs an entirely different recipe to make tools (still works fine on anything that isnt tools???)
- a small amount of endermen look depressed, and endermen *flooded* the other dimensions for an hour or two after the shift. they're obviously social creatures, so maybe their families were in the end and they weren't?

holy shit. 

there's a whole ass village. what the fuck.

---

there's another. there's a whole bunch of them over here, what the hell happened here. 
these have to have been populated, the ground here is *literally* dust, but there's no dust on anything here. none. 

---

WHAT DID THEY DO
I made the waystone public, so some people could maybe figure out what happened, but someone TORE THE BUILDINGS DOWN and they're now setting up a fucking SHOPPING CENTER.

---

decided to start looting the buildings because its obvious that nobody's gonna be home in a long while, but something's been getting at me. the lack of signs or notes. at firelink and just about everywhere that has people in it, you'll find signs, notes, PROOF of people aside from buildings. there's nothing, no notes, at all. i'd be satisfied if I found a note in another language, because then there'd be PROOF!
